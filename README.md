# sentiment-analysis-on-Amazon-reviews


## What is opinion mining?

In computer science, opinion mining also referred to as sentiment analysis is an approach of natural language processing referring to an analysis that identifies the tone emerging from a body of text on large amounts of data. It aims to determine an evaluation, a judgement or more overall an emotional state with regard to a given topic.

Opinion mining is a growing and promising research field widely applied to reviews and social media to categorize opinions.


## Why is it so useful nowadays?

In the recent years, we have been witnessing the explosion of what is commonly referred to as participatory sensing. Ordinary people take a proactive role in posting comments and complaints online, increasingly using technology to record information about events and issues in all dimensions of their political and social life.  It can be about a political candidate they like, an article they didn't like, ...
Hence the reason why opinion mining approaches are seen as the cornerstones of largescale collaborative policymaking. 

	Political Sphere: 
In the context of political activism, everyone is not only eager to share their political orientation but also curious to know the voice of others. Social media platforms make it easy to capture the numerous aspects of public opinion. These sites have begun to have a significant impact on how people think and act and thus are becoming essential to provide support to the verification of population trends in politics domain. Extracting citizens' opinions on government decisions from social media is therefore an increasingly important issue.

	Retail Sales
With the evolution of traditional stores to online shopping over the time, product reviews are becoming more and more important. Consumers around the world are sharing reviews directly on product pages in real time creating one huge database which is constantly being updated. For example, the amount of reviews on Amazon has increased tremendously over the past years. This vast amount of consumer reviews creates an opportunity for businesses to see how the market reacts to a specific product and how a given company can adapt its stocks. If businesses are able to categorize products according to certain patterns based on their reviews it could help them choose which type of products should be dropped from their stock, which one should they keep, and which others could they get. For example, if a group of different suitcases is highly rated and that people seem to like the materials, the dimensions and the colors, it probably means that products with similar proprieties should be kept.


## Project

The objective of this project is to analyze the correlation between the Amazon product reviews and the rating of the products given by consumers. I would like to create a supervised learning model able to classify a given customer review as positive, neutral and negative, and thus affect an overall score to a given review: is the consumer happy of his purchase? Is he disappointed? Is he just neutral?
